# Scene Understanding for Autonomous Vehicles
### Master in Computer Vision - M5 Visual recognition
<p align="justify"><b>Overview:</b> In this project we focus on scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. Understanding the context of the own vehicle is key for autonomous driving. The project consists of three parts or stages, corresponding to object detection, recognition/classification and semantic segmentation.
Furthermore, we aim to learn the basic concepts, techniques, tricks and libraries to develop and evaluate deep neural networks.
